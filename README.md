CodeDAO is a only fully decentralized code hosting platform in the world based on [cyfs protocol](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS)

The vision of CodeDAO is to provide global developers a public and liberal platform, a platform that of the developers, by the developers, for the developers.

+ CodeDAO White Paper(Coming soon)  

# What CodeDAO provides to developers
+ A fully decentralized git hosting platform
+ Using DAO to operate open-source project
+ Application DAO for the public platform
+ A platform truly owned by developers

# How CodeDAO works
CodeDAO is built on CYFS, a next-generation Web3 infrastructure technology that completely decentralizes and frees the Web.

Currently, open source projects can only develop underlying tools used by Web2 companies, making it hard to change the world like free software once did and earn income. With CYFS, you can develop open source Web3 apps, directly developing products that can benefit the public and earn income.


# Status
The source code in the initial version


# Development
CodeDAO service written in rust, and the frontend  written in tsx.
There are also a git-remote-helper component, which named `git-remote-cyfs` to tramsfor git object to web3 object(cyfs object)


(below develop guides part need to be replenish)
## Dec App
## www
## git-remote-cyfs




# TODOList
 - [ ] consensus algorithm repositorys
 - [ ] documentation improve
 - [ ] friendly installer for git-remote-cyfs
